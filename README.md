# Unexpected Results with Zero Values in myFunction

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: incorrect handling of zero values in a function. The function `myFunction` is intended to perform an operation (addition in this example) on two input numbers. However, it incorrectly handles the case where either input is zero, leading to unexpected results. 

The bug is reproduced in `bug.js`, while the corrected implementation is shown in `bugSolution.js`.
